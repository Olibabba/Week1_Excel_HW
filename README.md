# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In a previous analysis I looked at the success of kickstarters in the US, and of kickstarters for theatre projects, and plays specifically. I was then able to determine an ideal fundraising goal to increase the odds of success for a new play. After this analysis my client launched their kickstarter and has raised a significant portion of their goal. 

### Purpose

Now, to give my client some expectations of the path ahead and to strategize for success, I will continue my analysis. I will look at the outcomes of other kickstarters based on launch date and based on initial goals.


## Analysis and Challenges


--Code
'''
=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful",Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000",Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<=4999",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays")
'''

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
